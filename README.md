Sit around and chat beside the firebase.

Built with React and Auth0, leveraging Firebase's live updating feature.

TODOs:

-Mobile responsiveness is good not great. Would benefit from an intermediary media query between desktop and mobile.
-Design is too flat. Would benefit from some material-design-style layering and shadows.
-All users should have a uniquely-colored name, not just one for "me" and one for "everyone else."
-Need a way to archive old messages, and a feature to 'load previous.' Right now it's an infinite thread.
-Implement notifications using the browser notification API.
-Refactor CSS to make better use of SASS.
